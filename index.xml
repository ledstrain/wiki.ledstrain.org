Most Android &amp;ldquo;color filter&amp;rdquo; apps just put a yellow/red transparent overlay on screen. This sort of works, but inherently reduces contrast. CF.lumen is unique though: an app that lets you change color temperature by directly reducing blue light emitted from the screen.

Blue light # One of the colours protected off from a screen with backlight, which has a spectrum of light that affects us in a different way than the other colours. In the last years it started to become a concern for people who work all day with a computer and appeared special glasses to block it, as it stimulates some brain activity after a few hours of use, provoking difficulty to sleep, plus other effects.</description></item><item><title>iOS</title><link>https://wiki.ledstrain.org/docs/review/software/ios/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wiki.ledstrain.org/docs/review/software/ios/</guid><description> Reference Links # LED Strain iOS Tag</description></item><item><title>Phone</title><link>https://wiki.ledstrain.org/docs/review/hardware/phone/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wiki.ledstrain.org/docs/review/hardware/phone/</guid><description>Reference Links # LED Strain phone Tag &amp;ldquo;Usable Smartphones&amp;rdquo; mega-thread CF.lumen Essential # ðŸ›‘ threepeeo on reddit found PWM at all brightness levels (appears to be 230 Hz) ðŸ›‘ Sunspark got eyestrain ðŸ›‘ Olgomar found PWM at all brightness levels âœ” CCitrine : &amp;ldquo;No eyestrain at all&amp;rdquo; HTC One M8 # XDA forum thread ðŸ›‘ Sunspark got eyestrain: post1 post2 .
