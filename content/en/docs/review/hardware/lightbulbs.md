* [logixoul](https://ledstrain.org/d/1176-flicker-free-led-lightning-its-the-most-important-thing-which-one-to-buy/18): "I measured it and it has **no flicker**. I cannot speak as to its subjective eyestrain amount yet."

## Other flicker-aware lightbulb reviews

* [Peter Erwin's Der Lichtpeter](https://www.derlichtpeter.de/en/light-flicker/market-tests/) flicker-tests a large number of lights available in Germany using professional equipment
* [LEDBenchmark](http://ledbenchmark.com/list.php?fitt=6&voltage=2&order=17) flicker-tests lights available in Australian shops
* [Silas S. Brown's lighting notes](https://ssb22.user.srcf.net/elec/lighting.html) (some UK-bought products, adult with flicker sensitivity and cellphone camera) (site also has notes on the advantages of dark mode and how to get it on some web browsers and other software)
* [IEEE 1789-2015](https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/1789/4479/) is a recommended (but sadly not enforced or widely labelled) standard about reducing flicker in LED lights
