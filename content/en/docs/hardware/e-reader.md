EInk devices doesn't cause problems to most of the people, including those who have eyestrain with certain devices, but for some, android 9 causes eyestrain.
Those users who have problems with android 9 even on eInk, ensure they don't have problem with android 4, 5, 6 or 7, being 8 or 10 not yet tested for android 9 sensitive users

A proposed way to fix, or lower, the eyestrain is to enter into Developer options and disabling Force GPU options and Hardware overlay option. Disabling anti-aliasing options may also help. (Android dithering thread: https://ledstrain.org/d/32-android-dithering)

Dasung Paperlike Pro 13" eInk monitor, 2019 version, also causes with some setups eyestraining problems, but for most of the people it is not the case.
