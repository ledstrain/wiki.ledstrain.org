It\u0026rsquo;s process is simple: when brightness is at 100%, the LED\u0026rsquo;s are on an always-on configuration, but when it\u0026rsquo;s dimmed, the LED\u0026rsquo;s blink at an ultra fast speed unnoticeable for the brain, staying in an OFF position for more fractions of second as more you dim the brightness.

The problem is called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) and you can read more about it here - http://www.tftcentral.co.uk/articles/pulse_width_modulation.htm\nThere may be more reasons for the issues people who come to this forum have, but this is the one so far we can measure.\nIt is important to note that you cannot trust any reviews that claim the device youre about to buy does not use PWM, as displays on phones, tablets, laptops and other tech are sourced from more manufacturers for each brand. All you can do is test for yourself and trust yourself.\nWe are building an amateur oscilloscope with fraction of the money the real professional ones cost. If you have a friend who can lend you a real one, it is a better and more accurate choice. First you need to download Christian Zeitnitz soundcard oscope software here - https://www.zeitnitz.eu/scope_en\nWe will be transferring light signal to sound, so you need a probe that can pick up light. A simple photodiode will do, for my device I used this one (Europe shop) - https://www.conrad.de/de/fotodiode-dil-1100-nm-60-osram-bpw-34-153005.html\nA better one recommended to me was this one, I will use it in my next probe - https://www.conrad.de/de/fotodiode-to-39-820-nm-55-osram-bpw-21-152977.html\nYou have to solder the diode to a sound cable that you can connect to the soundcard or your computers microphone jack. A simple 3,5mm stereo jack will do. That one, when taken apart, has three pins - Left ear, Right ear and Ground. You have to connect the photodiode pins to either left or right, and then to Ground. As long as one pin is connected to the Ground, if the other is L or R does not seem to matter. This kind of soldering is fairly easy, just be careful not to use too powerful solder tool so you do not melt the photodiode with the heat alone. There is a certain voltage going through when the diode is picking up light, as it serves similarly as when you have a solar powered calculator. There is a report to be careful not to fry the sound-card, however I encountered no problems so far and the voltage seems to be very small to be able to cause any damage. Just in case though, its good to -\nUse external sound card. You can buy one cheaply second hand off ebay, or a new one. The reading should be better when a quality sound-card is applied, instead of basic notebook sound card. Also if you would happen to fry it, you just have to replace the card. My external card has a range of 44,1 Khz, which means it can probably read PWM up to 44Khz. Any higher and I would need more professional grade equipment. Newest macbooks are reported to have PWM at 112Khz for example.\nNow, connect the card to the computer, open up the oscilloscope software, select the input card in the settings and you are set. Example photo is my external display with lowered brightness to 80%. PWM free only at 100% brightness.\nA more portable option, although maybe not so accurate, is to use your smartphone and connect the diode to its headphone jack. You can then get an oscope application from either android store or apple store.

I am following the instructions at …\nInstalling Paranoid Android on OnePlus 3 Gurm AGI Oh man, where to start? I'm no good at basic instructions, but here's some answers:\nYou need a modified recovery manager. TWRP is \"TeamWin Recovery\", which is one such modified recovery manager. Booting into recovery mode allows you to install software onto the rest of the phone's partitions. Do you NEED this? No. But if you don't have it, the built-in recovery tends to put things back the way that it shipped... so yeah, you kind of do. Can you put this onto the phone with a program? Noooooooot usually. You need ADB - see point 2. Sometimes hackers (like the guys at XDA) have put together an all-in-one program that loads stuff to a phone. These exist for Samsung, and LG... but probably NOT for OnePlus? I haven't looked yet, though. And frankly I prefer to do this myself. Flash is a synonym for \"write to firmware\". When you \"flash TWRP\", you are putting the TWRP program into the recovery partition. This is generally done through ADB, which is a command-line interface provided by Google. ADB stands for \"Android DeBugger\", IIRC. Anyway, ADB connects the phone to your PC and allows you to \"flash\" things to it, issue commands, reboot it, put it into different modes, etc. AOSPA is in fact \"Android Open Source\" Paranoid Android, although... I don't know if those Zips contain the whole image. I'd download it from the PA site directly, if I were you. But yes, they come in ZIP and you put the ZIP onto the phone storage and then boot into TWRP and install it which overwrites the OS. GAPPS is Google Apps (gmail, drive, etc.) ARM, x86, and x86_64 are processor types. The OnePlus3 has a 64-bit chip. I'd get that version. SuperSu is only needed if you have apps that require root. If you intend to use the built-in apps as well as ones from the store, it isn't needed usually.

Bad tech (or bad lighting) may interact with binocular vision, either causing additional troubles to people who have underlying problems or causing troubles to people who have perfect vision.\nA very simple binocular vision self-test is a Brock string test . You can test yourself before an eyestrain and in the middle of it to understand what\u0026rsquo;s going on. Brock string can also be a basic exercise.\nIf you suspect some underlying binocular vision problems you may consult with an optometrist and try:\npatching one eye (thread: One-Eye-Success for 10+ users on LEDStrain ) exercises, a.k.a. \u0026ldquo;vision therapy\u0026rdquo; (you can learn some exercises at Martin\u0026rsquo;s website about heterophoria ) prism lenses (also discussed in thread: One-Eye-Success for 10+ users on LEDStrain . One example here ) Helpful links:\nMartin\u0026rsquo;s website about heterophoria Binocular vision troubles thread If your core problem is bad tech and not an underlying condition, they can help you only partially (or not help at all). Patching one eye has the best chance to lessen tech influence.\nExercises and lens are not a cure if you never had any binocular vision problems. In that case, you better avoid bad tech and track your health with the Brock string test. You also can do exercises to help you get rid of symptoms faster, but be careful. Avoid overdoing them and avoid doing any exercises through pain, in some cases, it can make things worse: the bad screen will overwork your eye muscles and exercises/lens can overwork them additionally ( example ).\nPlease note that tech can affect your light sensitivity, lead to red eyes, etc. Track your eye health during exercises and patching. If you notice that your eyes or one open eye have increased light sensitivity, a lot of new visible blood vessels on the conjunctiva, or signs of inflammation ( post with example ), consider avoiding the bad screen.\nPrism lenses reviews # Several of our users have tried prism lenses. Here are summaries of their feedback on this:\nmartin: The help for me first were glasses with prismatic lenses, that eased the problems by about 50%. bkdo: \u0026ldquo; I definitely have some strain from trying to adjust, but I\u0026rsquo;m absolutely noticing a reduction in flicker sensitivity. \u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo; I\u0026rsquo;m currently wearing lenses with this prescription \u0026amp; have about a 60-70% reduction in symptoms. I noticed the 60-70% relief from flicker symptoms pretty quickly, within a few days IIRC. It definitely took a long time to actually adjust to the lenses ensete: \u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; They recommended adding prism to some lenses, so I had some custom lenses made up and they didn\u0026rsquo;t help at all.\u0026quot; Dominic: Then I got prismatic eyeglasses. I didn\u0026rsquo;t feel comfortable in any of them (I got three pairs). One of them made me sick to the point I was up all night due to horrific headache. The weakest prisms I got were bearable, but didn\u0026rsquo;t give me any significant relief. Trying to get used to I was wearing them for two weeks, then I gave up. Today I tried \u0026ldquo;vertical\u0026rdquo; prisms and my body reaction was pretty much the same as it was when I was trying my first and second prism lenses - I got a severe headache, pain around my eyes, dizziness AGI: What a dreadful experience. [\u0026hellip;] In the next couple of days I wore the glasses pretty much every time I worked on my laptop and even when I used PCs connected to a monitor and at night in bed reading from my phone, a book and my Kindle. Long story short, on day 4 I had developed so much pain in my arms, wrists and legs down to my ankles (can you believe it!) and spams in my face and my arms that I put the glasses in the case and sealed it.

It is worth mentioning, though. First of all, poor image quality may happen on inexpensive phones or smaller Chinese brands.\nMay be present on 1-2 screens. If you are concerned about pain on a large number of devices, this is hardly the reason.\nThe phones of the same model can have different LCD screens (different suppliers, panels, different factories etc.), and also there could be one screen of different quality. This primarily applies to phones made by smaller Chinese brands. Be careful when purchasing and try to check a particular phone with your own eyes in advance.\nExamples:\nan article about different screen suppliers for iPhone 13 , post about 7 same POCO X3 NFC with 7 different screens (in Russian) , two Honor 50 comparison with the same settings , variation in the quality of polarizers in oppo and vivo PWM: stroboscopic invisible flicker # Notice that there are two important numbers to measure: PWM frequency and PWM flicker ratio.

Those symptoms alone are not enough to differentiate this problem from other sources. It is better to check sensitivity to other sources before coming to the conclusion that you have problem X.\nIf you have problem X, it is important to know the following: the problem has spread within phones since about 2017 (Xiaomi since 2016). No safe models have been found yet. If you have an old safe device, do not rush to sell it / throw it away. Try not to break it. When replacing the broken screen or when purchasing that same old model, you may encounter problem X again: there\u0026rsquo;s no guarantee that the old screen and the new screen will be the same screen.
