Those users who have problems with android 9 even on eInk, ensure they don&amp;rsquo;t have problem with android 4, 5, 6 or 7, being 8 or 10 not yet tested for android 9 sensitive users
A proposed way to fix, or lower, the eyestrain is to enter into Developer options and disabling Force GPU options and Hardware overlay option.</description></item><item><title>Desktop Monitor</title><link>https://wiki.ledstrain.org/docs/review/hardware/desktop-monitor/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wiki.ledstrain.org/docs/review/hardware/desktop-monitor/</guid><description>Reference Links # LED Strain desktop-monitor Tag Dell U2410 # âœ” MagnuM : &amp;ldquo;The Dell U2410 has been my savior for a long time now.&amp;rdquo; Monitor Buying Guide 2018 noigmn I might try the Dell U2410 too if I can get one.
